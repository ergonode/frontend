How to do a release and publish modules:

1. Make sure you have publish access for all packages:
    - You must be in the developers team in the npm @ergonode organization
    - You must have publish access to all @ergonode modules
2. Create release branch from develop branch (release/v0.9.0).
3. Switch to release branch and edit everything you need for the release.
4. Run `npm run publish:all ${semver}` - semver is semantic version (1.0.0, major, minor, path, etc.)
5A. If everything works properly, all modules are published and CHANGELOG will be created
5B. If the publish fails half-way, things have gotten hairy. Now you need to
    go to npm to check which packages have been published and manually publish
    the ones that have not been published yet.
5. Edit CHANGELOG and other things and push changes to release branch.
4. Go to GitHub and merge release branch to master branch.
5. Go to GitHub and verify that the changelog is live.
6. Go to GitHub releases page and publish the release.
7. Merge master branch to develop branch.

## Is it production ready

No! At the moment we have only one testing implementation to production environment (with more than 150k+ product indexes and integration with Magento Commerce 2.3), but in our opinion system still needs to be stabilised and we recommend not to use it at the moment in production mode. We still develop the core and there could be a lot of changes in the near future. If you want to know when it will be production ready look at Ergonode Roadmap.
